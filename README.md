# prediction-model
In this project I am working on the Price prediction of the household in the banglore city.
In Bangaluru House Data there are 9 variables. 'area_type'	'availability'	'location'	'size'	'society'	'total_sqft'	'bath'	'balcony'	'price'
out of which some were not required for the data analysis.
I used R Studio for this project.
Some libraries which are used in this project are 
dplyr
tidyr
tidyverse
ggplot2
purrr
caTools
fastDummies
caret
naivebayes
